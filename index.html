                              <li> Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears. <br>In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central China  </li>
                              <li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat <br>small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.</li>
                              <li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>

                                   Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to<br> and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.

                               <li>
                                   Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. 
                                   <br>The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.

                                   The world's smallest stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall!<br> It was created by South African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.

                               <li> There are around 3,000 cicada species, according to National Geographic<br> so they vary in size from 0.75 to 2.25 in (2.2 to 5.5 cm) long. Cicadas can be black, brown or green and can have red, white or blue eyes.</li>
                               <li>
                                   Cicadas can live a relatively long time: 4 to 17 years.

                                   Their wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a light source. The veins on the tips of the wings of some cicadas make the shape of a W.
